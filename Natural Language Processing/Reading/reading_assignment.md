### Intro
Stanza is a Python-based NLP toolkit developed by a group of researchers at Stanford University, including Peng Qi, Yuhao Zhang, Yuhui Zhang, Jason Bolton, and Christopher D. Manning. The toolkit supports multiple human languages and provides various NLP tools such as tokenization, parsing, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and more. Stanza is designed to be flexible and can be used for both research and production purposes.

| Topic | Stanza: A Python Natural Language Processing Toolkit for Many Human Languages |
| Challenge | The lack of easy-to-use and accessible NLP libraries for different languages and domains. The need for faster and more efficient NLP models for large-scale text processing. |
|  | The requirement for more flexible and extensible NLP toolkits that can be easily customized for different NLP tasks and domains. |
|  | The need for NLP toolkits that are built on top of modern machine learning frameworks, such as PyTorch, to leverage the latest developments in deep learning and other NLP techniques. |
| Feature method | Stanza works by converting raw text input into a structured representation and using the structured representation to perform NLP tasks. The toolkit leverages the latest developments in deep learning and other NLP techniques, and is designed to be flexible, extensible, and compatible with different programming languages and platforms. |
| Limitation | Stanza not being state-of-the-art in every NLP task, limited language coverage, high computational resource requirements, and potential performance issues with small or domain-specific data. |
| Conclusion and Future work | Show file differences that haven't been stagedc |
