### Intro
Stanza is a Python-based NLP toolkit developed by a group of researchers at Stanford University, including Peng Qi, Yuhao Zhang, Yuhui Zhang, Jason Bolton, and Christopher D. Manning. The toolkit supports multiple human languages and provides various NLP tools such as tokenization, parsing, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and more. Stanza is designed to be flexible and can be used for both research and production purposes.
