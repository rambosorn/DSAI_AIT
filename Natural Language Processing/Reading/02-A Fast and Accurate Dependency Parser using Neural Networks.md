link: https://aclanthology.org/D14-1082.pdf
### Intro
A new approach to dependency parsing in natural language processing using neural networks. Dependency parsing is the task of identifying the relationships between words in a sentence. They propose using a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks to build a parser that is fast and accurate. The results show that this neural network approach outperforms existing methods in terms of speed and accuracy. The paper presents a promising solution to the challenge of dependency parsing.
